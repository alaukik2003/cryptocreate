Seasons Of Code 2022 Project

This Project on Blockchain, initially we have been given a YT course on blockchain to complete 
for understanding the underlying theory behind blockchain.
I have covered a small portion of it wherein I have learned about what blockchain is, some basic terms related to it like Public Ledger, Decentralized, distributed networks, etc.
I have some basics about cryptographic hash functions, Merkle trees, what are they and a basic idea with regards to their functioning.
I have also learned about high level functioning of bitcoins, crowdfunding via smart contracts, also basics about Public Key Encryption.
Now, I have started to know about how Bitcoin Functions in a bit more detail and have taken a pause due to midsems which are coming up, will cover the rest after the exams.
